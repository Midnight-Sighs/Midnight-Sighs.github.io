                    I started streaming in late Jun of '23, mostly because my best friend told me I should.  More than that, though, it was a way to hold myself accountable to taking some me time and allowed me to set healthier boundaries about my WFH hours (and far exceeding them on my own time).  Since he "made me do it", I've found that I love it.  I love the time to do fun things, I love adding stream toys, I love making new scenes and playing with streamer.bot...but most of all, I love meeting new people who show up to share in the things that I love and have fun with me.  Without people to hang out, streaming would be nothing.  So if you've made it here, I thank you! Whether you're a long-time supporter, a newbie, or somewhere in between, I thank you, even just for taking the time in being here!
