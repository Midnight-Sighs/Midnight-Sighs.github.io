                    Talking about oneself is always an awkward thing, but I shall attempt to do it anyway.  My name is unofficially Midnight, but I've also gone by the pen name of Arreis Kurai (a pen name I devised for myself when I was in the 5th grade).  Under this name, I've attemped to write, draw, paint, and craft, but in gaming I've always been Midnight.  Back in the days of the original Diablo, where you had to use other characters to hold your loot, I named all of them "Midnight this", "Midnight that", and one of them used a weapon that was a sai and was thereby named "Midnight Sai".  Being the young emo child I was, Midnight Sigh seemed a dark and poetic name to me.  Thus I added the "s" to the end, mashed the names together with an underscore or no space at all, and it has been my gamer tag ever since.  However, because it's my default name on everything, I've been asked on multiple occasions if I prefer using the name Midnight even outside of gaming and more and more I'm getting it to stick.  I feel it suits me better, even if I'm not the emo kid anymore.

                    Technically, this portfolio was originally supposed to be a place to showcase I can write code for potential employers.  That I can do.  Since I started learning in August of '21, I decided I never want to turn back.  I love the combination of logic and creativity that developing with front end frameworks allow for and I feel like I've learned and grown rapidly in the short time I've been doing it.  Regardless of where my code takes me in the next few years, I want to try to continue to maintain all my own passions and projects.  Hence, this page will contain all the parts of me that I want to show off.

                    So, aside from bring a front end developer, I'm a gamer (table top and digital, since the days of NES), an artist, a streamer, a black belt, and even dabble in writing from time to time.  I'm eccentric and sometimes hyperactive.  Sometimes my brain goes a million miles a minute and other times it's completely empty of anything useful.  I'm interested in everything from how people lived in the days of old to cars to crafts to astronomy to martial arts to....to.....you get the idea.  I'm interested, at least on a base level, in just about everything.

                    The following was a prompt from CoPilot about what to write next.  I was surprised and amused, so here it is XD

                    I'm a jack of all trades, master of none.  I'm a nerd, a geek, a dork, and a weirdo.  I'm a little bit of everything and I'm proud of it.  I'm a work in progress, but I'm always trying to improve myself.  I'm a little bit of everything and I'm proud of it.
